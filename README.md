# Meet Passy! A Python Password Generator

We all need random passwords. Sometimes we happen to have python installed. Need a quick random password? Here's a solution.

## Generate a secure password

Coming up with your own password can be difficult. And I don't trust having a single point of failure with something list LastPass. Behold, a simple tool to generate your own passwords with the following numbers.

1. Uppercase Letters
2. Lowercase Letters
3. Special Characters
4. Numbers

## Usage

1. Download __passy.py__ or clone the project.
2. Change the default parameters for the password (minimum 16 characters, maximum 32 characters)
3. Once in the correct directory, in Linux type `python3 passy.py` or in Windows type `python passy.py`.

## Issues/Warnings

_Note_: This is a work in progress. There are currently a lot of remaining security issues remaining in this program. __Do not run this in a production/professional environment__.
